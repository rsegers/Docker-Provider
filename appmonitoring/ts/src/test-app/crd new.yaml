          description: >-
            Configures application monitoring in the current namespace. Multiple CRs of this kind are allowed within a namespace. 
            
            CR named _default_ will be used for every workload in the namespace unless speicifically overridden through annotations.
            To use a different CR _crName_ for a particular workload, mark it with _instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-\<language\>="\<crName\>"_ annotation.

            Multiple annotations (for different languages) may be applied to the same workload. Annotations must be placed at the workload's spec level (_spec.template.metadata.annotations_) level. Currently, only deployments are supported.
            
            Examples of annotation usage:

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="true"
            Uses the default CR for the namespace with Java instrumentation (regardless of which languages the default CR specifies)

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="false"
            Disables all instrumentation regardless of which languages the default CR specifies, or which language-specific annotation is used.

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="true"
            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet="true"
            Uses the default CR for the namespace with Java and .NET instrumentation (regardless of which languages the default CR specifies)

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="true"
            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet="false"
            Uses the default CR for the namespace with Java (regardless of which languages the default CR specifies)

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="alternativeCrInThisNamespace"
            Uses a different, non-default CR named _alternativeCrInThisNamespace_ found within the namespace with Java instrumentation (regardless of which languages that CR specifies)

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-java="crName1"
            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet="crName2"
            Invalid configuration, deployment will fail.

            instrumentation.opentelemetry.io/inject-dotnet="crThatDoesNotExist"
            Invalid configuration since the CR does not exist, deployment will continue with no instrumentation.
